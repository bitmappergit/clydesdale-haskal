This directory contains the text of the online version of the
tutorial.  The file tutorial.lhs contains the version that describes
the Unix/Emacs interface to Yale Haskell, and mac-tutorial.lhs contains
the version that describes the Macintosh interface.  The text of the
two versions is mostly identical except for the instructions about how
to use the user interface.

Form feeds divide the pages of the tutorial.  Emacs has a special mode
just for the tutorial which makes a local copy of each page for the
user to scribble on without disturbing this source.  

It is possible that this could be adapted to the command interface by
breaking it up into one file per page.

This is still preliminary - we need to work on the text and examples.
Please send comments to haskell-request@cs.yale.edu.
