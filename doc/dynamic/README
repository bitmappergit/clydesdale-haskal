This describes the Dynamic typing system used in Yale Haskell.

The paper found here describes the basics of dynamic typing.

A good operational introduction to dynamic typing can be found in the
online tutorial.

Details can be found in $PRELUDE/PreludeDynamic and
$PRELUDE/PreludeDeriving

The mechanism for creating new derivable instances is not yet
documented except for the tutorial pages and comments in PreludeDeriving.

I have not yet implemented skolem types correctly in recursive
functions.   In

f :: [a] -> [Dynamic]
f [] = []
f (x:xs) = toDynamic x : f dx

each dynamic created will have a different skolem type.
