This directory contains command scripts used for building Yale Haskell
from the source distribution under AKCL.  Please note that we do not
officially support Yale Haskell under AKCL and that none of this has
been tested by us.

Developers need to source haskell-development instead of haskell-setup
in the .cshrc file.

To rebuild the system:

* You need to define environment variables Y2 and AKCL to point to the
  appropriate pathnames.  See the haskell-development script for details.

* Make sure that the environment variable PRELUDEBIN (in the 
  haskell-setup script) points to $PRELUDE/akcl.

* Execute the "compile" script.  This will recompile all of the Lisp 
  source files that make up the Yale Haskell system.  Compiled files are
  put in the "akcl" subdirectory of each source directory.

* Execute the "build-prelude" script to compile the standard prelude.  
  Note that this process tends to use up a huge amount of memory!

* Execute the "savesys" script to build a new executable.

* The new executable is initially called "bin/new-akcl-haskell".  Try
  it out.  If it works, you should rename it to "bin/akcl-haskell".
  Make sure that HASKELLPROG (in the haskell-setup script) is correct.

We do not support our Haskell-to-CLX interface under AKCL, either.
