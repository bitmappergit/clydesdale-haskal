This directory contains command scripts used for building Yale Haskell
from the source distribution under CLISP.  Please note that we do not
officially support Yale Haskell under CLISP and that none of this has
been tested by us.

Developers need to source hsk-development instead of hsk-setup before using
the Yale Haskell system.

To rebuild the system:

* You should have at least 8 MB RAM.

* You need to define environment variables Y2 and CLISP to point to the
  appropriate pathnames.  Execute the hsk-begin script from the top level
  directory.

* Make sure that the environment variable PRELUDEBIN (in the 
  hsk-setup script) points to $PRELUDE/clisp.

* Execute the "compile" script.  This will recompile all of the Lisp 
  source files that make up the Yale Haskell system.  Compiled files are
  put in the "clisp" subdirectory of each source directory.

* Execute the "build-prelude" script to compile the standard prelude.
  Note that this step will use no less than 25 MB memory (RAM + swap space).
  If you haven't that much, skip this step.

* Execute the "savesys" script to build a new executable.
  This step uses about 10 MB memory. 8 MB RAM and some swap space should
  suffice.

* The new executable is initially called "bin/new-clisp-haskell".  Try
  it out.  If it works, you should rename it to "bin/clisp-haskell".
  Make sure that HASKELLPROG (in the hsk-setup script) is correct.
