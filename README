This is the main directory for the 2.x release of Yale Haskell.

If you are using Yale Haskell on a Unix system, you should set the
variable $HASKELL and source the haskell-setup script in this
directory before attempting to use Yale Haskell.

If you are using Yale Haskell on a Macintosh, you can just double-click
on the Haskell icon.

If you are rebuilding from the source release, see the scripts and
README files in the $HASKELL/com area.

Please read the manual for more information about how to use and
install Yale Haskell.


Here are some notes about the organization of the files in this
directory tree.

Each directory containing source files has separate subdirectories to
contain binary files for each of the various Lisps we support.  Each
directory containing source files should also have a file that defines
a compilation unit for that directory.  (See "support/compile.scm" for
information about the compilation unit utility.)  "support/system.scm"
loads all the compilation unit definitions.

Loading "cl-support/cl-init.lisp" will load the entire Haskell system
into a fresh Lisp.  The scripts in the $HASKELL/com area do this for
you.

For information about the mumble compatibility package used as the
implementation language for the rest of the system, see
support/mumble.txt.  We've isolated all the system-specific parts of
the mumble support code in the "cl-support" directory.  The "support"
directory contains higher-level mumble support stuff.

We don't make extensive use of packages in our system.  Except for the
low-level mumble support, everything is in the MUMBLE-USER package.
